## 📖 Overview

The intersection of computer vision and human artistry, particularly in athletic movement, presents a compelling frontier for fine-grained analysis. The golf swing, a blend of precise biomechanics and fluid artistry, serves as an ideal case study for understanding the human form "in the wild."

This repository contains the official code and data for our work on providing golfers with accessible, real-time, and actionable feedback using a standard smartphone camera. Our system can:
* 🏌️‍♂️ Track the golf clubhead in real-time.
* 📐 Analyze the swing plane against established biomechanical models.
* 📊 Classify swings as "On Plane," "Over the Top," or "Underneath."
* 📱 Run efficiently on mobile devices for on-the-range feedback.

## ⛳ The ClubheadDB Dataset

To train and validate our system, we introduce **ClubheadDB**, a new dataset for fine-grained analysis of the golf swing.

* **Content**: 100+ videos of golf swings sourced from YouTube and Reddit.
* **Annotations**: Each video is annotated with frame-level labels for the clubhead position.
* **Expert Labels**: Each swing is classified as "On Plane," "Over the Top," or "Underneath" by a human golf expert.

This dataset is provided to encourage further research into fine-grained athletic performance analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### 2. Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/golf-swing-analysis.git](https://github.com/your-username/golf-swing-analysis.git)
cd golf-swing-analysis
```

Next, create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:
```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (on Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate
# Activate it (on macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download and Process the Data

You can download all the video clips and extract their frames using the provided script. The script reads `data/metadata.csv` to get the list of videos.

```bash
python src/download_and_process.py
```
This will:
1.  Create a `videos/` directory and download the clips into it.
2.  Create a `frames/` directory and extract the frames from each video.

## 📊 Using the Data

After running the script, your directory will look like this:
```
golf-swing-analysis/
│
├── frames/
│   ├── video_id_1/
│   │   └── images/
│   │       ├── 0001.png
│   │       └── ...
│   └── ...
│
└── videos/
    ├── video_id_1.mp4
    └── ...
```

The expert labels for each swing (used for our classification task) are available in `data/labels.csv`.
