**ClubheadDB** is a web-sourced dataset for computer vision research in golf swing analysis, with a focus on clubhead detection. It contains over 10,000 ‚Äúdown-the-line‚Äù frames from public golf swing videos, each hand-annotated with precise clubhead locations. The dataset is fully reproducible: we provide the metadata (video URLs, timestamps) and final annotations, along with scripts to download and extract the exact set of frames used in our study.

## üåü Dataset Highlights

| Feature                | Value                      | Description                                                              |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unique Golfers** | 67+                        | Video-level split: 47 Train, 10 Validation, 10 Test.                     |
| **Total Annotated Frames** | 10,180                     | A single bounding box annotation exists for each frame (zero for null examples).          |
| **Video Sources** | YouTube (46%), Reddit (54%) | Sourced from public posts to ensure a wide variety of conditions.        |
| **Skill Level Mix** | Pros (42%), Amateurs (58%) | Includes a mix of professional and amateur golfers.                      |
| **Club Type Mix** | Irons (70%), Drivers (27%) and Woods (3%) | A diverse set of clubs to ensure model generalization.                   |

## üöÄ Getting the Data

The entire process is managed by the `clubheaddb` command-line tool.

### Final Data Structure

After running the pipeline, you will have a `frames/` directory organized as follows. This structure is designed to be easy to parse, view, and use for further processing.
```plaintext
frames/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ swing_001/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frame_0001.jpg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frame_0002.jpg
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frame_0001.txt
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frame_0002.txt
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```
Each `.txt` file contains the bounding box annotations for the corresponding image in YOLO format. Images with no clubhead present will have an empty `.txt` file.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following command-line tools installed and available in your system's `PATH`:
-   **Python** (3.8 or higher)
-   **yt-dlp**: For downloading video clips from YouTube and Reddit. ([Installation Guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation))
-   **ffmpeg**: For extracting frames from videos. ([Installation Guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html))

### Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to build the dataset on your local machine.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```plaintext
git clone [https://github.com/unknownauthor23/ClubheadDB.git](https://github.com/unknownauthor23/ClubheadDB.git) 
cd ClubheadDB
```

#### Step 2: Install the Package
This repository is configured as an installable Python package. Run the following command in the root directory of the repository. This will automatically install all required Python libraries (like pandas and tqdm) and make the build script available as a command-line tool.

```plaintext
pip install .
```

#### Step 3: Run the Build Command

Now, you can build the entire dataset by running a single command in your terminal:
```plaintext
clubhead-build
```
This command will execute the full pipeline:

1.  It reads `metadata/metadata.csv` to find the video clips.
2.  It downloads the clips into a local `videos/` directory.
3.  It extracts frames from the videos into the `frames/swing_xxx/images/` structure.
4.  It reads `annotations/annotations.parquet` and creates the corresponding `.txt` label files in the `frames/swing_xxx/labels/` structure.

The process may take a significant amount of time depending on your internet connection and the number of videos.
